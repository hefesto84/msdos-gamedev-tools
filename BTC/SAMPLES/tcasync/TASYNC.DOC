Turbo C Async Routines.
By Joe DeRosa Latest Rev 11/15/87
Tested at up to 9600 baud on 8mhz V30.
Tested at up to 19200 baud on 10mhz 80286.
By increasing Buffer size, Higher baud rates should work on slower machines.
If you use this program great you can send me millions of dollars. But let's be
real nobody pays for shareware. So if you do send money then I will be totally
suprised. I had fun writing this stuff and I hope it helps you all out. There is
NO documentation and there will be none other than this document and the comment
in the code. If you wish to pay money send to:

Or you can send a postcard saying thanks or whatever.

Remember always take your fun seriously and
         never  take yourself seriously.
