Files are described by up to 8 characters plus an extension name of up to
3 characters. Whereas the file name is selected by the user, the extension
name is frequently defined by the system in use. Some typical extension
names relevant to MS-DOS and Turbo C are:

.BAK  Backup source file - a resaved file automatically saves the
      original as a .BAK file.

.BAT  Batch file containing a sequence of MS-DOS command lines.
      The AUTOEXEC.BAT file is automatically executed when the computer
      is switched on, so that any required conditions are initialized.

.BGI  Borland Graphics Interface files, which are the graphics device
      drivers for the screen display.

.C    A C source code file (not compiled).

.COM  Compiled file, which is an executable file from MS-DOS.

.EXE  Executable file from MS-DOS.

.H    A header file, used in C to list the headers to previously prepared
      functions, which are stored in library (.LIB) files.

.HLP  Help file.

.LIB  Library files for mathematical, graphical functions, etc.

.MAP Contains information about the executable file, such as the list of the
     segemnts in the program, the program start address and any warning or
     error messages produced during the link.

.OBJ  Object file for the binary machine instructions produced by the
      compiler, before 'linking' with the library files to produce the
      final executable (.EXE) file.

.PCK  A list of the files previously being edited in the integrated
      development environment, for recall by File/Pick option.

.PRJ  A project file, containing the names of all files to be compiled and
      linked, when there are multiple source files (as allowed in C).

.SYS  System file used by MS-DOS.

.TXT  Text file in ASCII format.
