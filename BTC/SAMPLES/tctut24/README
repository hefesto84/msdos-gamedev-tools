The hardware requirements are any IBM PC compatible machine from XT
upwards, with 640kb memory and a VGA colour monitor.


There are 68 files on this diskette, which is labelled CTUTOR.

62 of these files are in the subdirectory \TC\CTUTOR and relate to the
display of Turbo C tutorial notes and example programs using the
object-oriented code of Turbo Vision. The example programs can also be
run from the Run examples submenu. The screen display can be adjusted
using the Windows submenu and mouse and colour options can be set using
the Options submenu.


The Notes are in files with the extension name .TXT, whilst the examples
are available as both source code (.C) and executable files (.EXE).
The main program that controls the display is CTUTOR.EXE and so the command
is just CTUTOR if the correct subdirectory has already been selected.

There are 6 files in the root directory of this diskette:

The README file is this one being read by means of the batch file INTRO.BAT

The DOS file CONFIG.SYS is in this directory, to allow a meaningful
operation of the program DOSOPS.EXE when using drive A:

There are two other batch files RUN.BAT and INST.BAT
The first allows operation directly from the diskette drive A: by typing
RUN and pressing the ENTER key.
The second transfers all the files in the A:\TC\CTUTOR subdirectory to the
hard disk drive C: in the subdirectory C:\TC\CTUTOR which is first created
by the batch file. The command is INST followed by the ENTER key.

The executable file REGISTER.EXE creates a letter to a selected charity.

The tutorial runs in Turbo Vision, which provides an environment similar
to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of Turbo C.

The initial screen display shows a Menu Bar at the top of the screen and
a Status Line at the bottom. The Status Line always provides essential
advice, typically that the function key F10 will access the Menu. Then
the arrow keys can be used to select the required menu item and the
sub-menu pulled down by pressing the ENTER key. The arrow keys can again
be used to select the required sub-menu option and that option activated
by pressing the ENTER key. The function key F1 always provides context
sensitive help, including any hot-key short cuts.
The hot-key combination Alt-X will immediately cause an exit to DOS.

Initially, using hot-key combinations, press Alt-N followed by L and
then the ENTER key to obtain a list of the text files available.
Alt-F3 will close the current display and return to the original screen.
Then press Alt-N followed by O to display a dialog box which offers
selection of the notes as text files. Press the Tab key and then use the
arrow keys to select the required text file and then press the ENTER key.

Good luck with learning Turbo C.
