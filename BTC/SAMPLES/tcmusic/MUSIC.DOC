The routines contained in the file 'sound.c' were published in the book
'BLUEBOOK of ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE ROUTINES for the IBM PC & XT'
published by the Waite group. The play lists contained in the file
'music.c' are from the same source. Following is an explanation of the
commands and instructions contained in the play lists.

    Tempo command:

       first byte:  =   ASCII 'T'

      second byte:  =   Tempo in whole notes per minute


    Note command :

       first byte:  =   ASCII 'N'

      second byte:  =   Pitch number ( integer 0 - 95 )

       third byte:  =   Length ( 8 bit binary fixed point - scale 1 )

      fourth byte:  =   Style ( 8 bit binary fixed point - scale 0 )


    Rest command :

       first byte:  =   ASCII 'R'

      second byte:  =   Length ( 8 bit binary fixed point - scale 1 )


    End  command :

       first byte:  =   ASCII 'X'


    The scaling is as follows: scale 0 has the binary point to the left of the
    leftmost digit and scale 1 has the binary point to the right of the left-
    most bit.

I'm not a musician so the only tunes I can offer are those in the book. If
anyone knows where I can find more or if you develop other tunes, please
leave me a message. Thanks. Ken Moore.
