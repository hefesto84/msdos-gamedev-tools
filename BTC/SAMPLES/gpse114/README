                        GPSE  Source  Code
                        ==================


About the program:
-----------------

This program takes RINEX pseudorange data files produced by GPS (Global
Positioning System) receivers and produces earth-fixed WGS84 positional
fixes. It cannot (as yet) deal with `raw' data from GPS receivers, use 
phase information or give velocities. Most commercial GPS receivers 
are able to output their data in RINEX format files (RINEX is a standard
which GPS manufacturers should adhere to), so it should be possible
to tailor this software to accept data from a wide variety of GPS types. 
Presently the software can deal only with specific GARMIN and LEICA
GPS units, but by looking at the software modules which deal with these
GPS types you should be able to include as many others as you please,
without too much difficulty. The software presently operates in the
following three modes: (i) Ordinary (non-differencing) 
(ii) Positional differencing   (iii)  Pseudorange differencing.

I have written this software mainly for three reasons: (seeing that GPS units
can output their positional data to files, one might ask what the point
of the software is!)

(i)    To allow differencing to be done using two GPS units where the
       operator has no control over the satellites used by the GPS units - 
       ie. where the GPS units are were not built to do differencing.

(ii)   To allow differencing to be done using different GPS units, or
       GPS units produced by different manufacturers.

(iii)  For educational purposes, and for the programmer who wishes to
       experiment with different algorithms (eg. the satellite selection
       algorithm, the data processing algorithm, the reference model
       for positional output, etc.). 



About the source code:
---------------------

The main file is GPSE.C.  Open this file in your C environment, and
BUILD  it. It should compile without errors, using any version of Borland C++.
   Run GPSE.EXE at your dos prompt to test the compiled program. Don't use the
tiny memory model when compiling, it will lead to problems. Use one of the
bigger models. To assist in tracing problems which may arise, some details
of my machine follow: it's a 386-DX-33 with 387, 4Mb RAM and an American
Megatrends Bios, dated  1990, running DOS 5.00. More details, including
author names and addresses, appear in GPSE.C  -  please take a look at this
file. The source code has been extensively commented in the hope that this
will make it easier for you to use and modify the program.


About the GPSE.EXE file  (How to `get started' info.)
-----------------------

The EXE file has been included so that the demo can be run immediately, and
also in case you have problems compiling the source code.
  There are two sets of demo data in the package: use each set separately,
don't mix them up (during processing). The data were recorded at different
times and it would make no sense to difference files from different sets.
Here is a short summary of the data files:

SET1:     xx.92o             Leica base unit observation file
          xx.92n                 "           nav file
          yy.92o             Leica roving unit obs file
          yy.92n                 "             nav file


SET2:     base.93n           Leica base unit, nav file
          base.93o           Leica base unit, obs file
          bill.93n           Garmin roving unit, nav file borrowed from above.
          bill.93o           Garmin roving unit, obs file.


When you run GPSE, the results will appear on the screen, as well as be
written to a file in which the last character of the extension is F. You
will notice a result file where the last character of the extension is an M.
This is a marker file which is used by a Matlab analysis program, and it can
safely be deleted. The important file is the result file, containing an F
in its extension.


Description of files:
--------------------

You should have received the following files in this package (file
sizes are approximate, and may have changed):
