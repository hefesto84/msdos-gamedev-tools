                         Distribution Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals who wish to distribute the RIE package to friends or associates 
may do so in accordance with the restrictions outlined in ORDER.FRM. 

Computer Clubs and User Groups wishing to add the RIE package to their disk 
library may do so in accordance with the Distribution Restrictions listed 
below. 

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As the exclusive copyright holder for RIE, Rimrock Software authorizes 
distribution only in accordance with the following restrictions. 

The RIE package is defined as containing all the material listed in the 
PACKING.LST file.  If any files listed in PACKING.LST, or the PACKING.LST file 
itself, are missing, then the package is not complete and distribution is 
forbidden.  Please contact us to obtain a complete package suitable for 
distribution. 

The RIE package - including all related program files and documentation files 
CANNOT be modified in any way and must be distributed as a complete package, 
without exception.  The PACKING.LST file contains a list of all files that are 
part of the RIE package. 

No price or other compensation may be charged for the RIE package.  A 
distribution fee may be charged for the cost of the diskette, shipping and 
handling, as long as the total (per disk) does not exceed US$8.00 in the U.S. 
and Canada, or US$12.00 internationally. 

Disk Sets & CD-ROMs:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RIE package CANNOT be sold as part of some other inclusive package, nor 
can it be included in any commercial software packaging offer, without a 
written agreement from Rimrock Software. 

   ASP Approved Vendors who wish to distribute the RIE package as part of a 
   collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) may do so 
   provided that all the other restrictions are met. 

   Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute the RIE package as 
   part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set, or a CD-ROM package) must 
   obtain permission from Rimrock Software prior to beginning such a 
   distribution. 

   If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection, 
   please check the release date of the version you have.  If the version is 
   over twelve (12) months old then please contact us to ensure that you have 
   the most current version.  This version was released in February, 1992.

Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you would like to distribute the RIE package as a Disk-of-the-Month, or as 
part of a subscription or monthly service, then the following restrictions 
apply: 

   ASP Associate (Disk Vendor) Members in good standing are hereby given 
   permission to distribute the RIE package under the Disk-of-the-Month style 
   of distribution. 

   Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that you have 
   the most current version of the software. 

   You cannot use a Disk-of-the-Month distribution to use up your inventory of 
   old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as Disk-of-
   the-Month disks. 

The PRINTED User's Guide may not be reproduced in whole or in part, using any 
means, without the written permission of Rimrock Software.  In other words, 
the disk-based documentation may not be distributed in PRINTED (hard copy) 
form. 

The RIE package cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others.

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or other 
literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".  Shareware is 
"Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free. 

Rimrock Software prohibits the distribution of outdated versions of the RIE 
package, without written permission from Rimrock Software.  If the version you 
have is over twelve (12) months old, please contact us to ensure that you have 
the most current version.  This version was released in February, 1992. 

Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile, 
disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed program 
except as provided in this agreement.  Any such unauthorized use shall result 
in immediate and automatic termination of this license. 

U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. 
Government of the computer software and documentation in this package shall be
