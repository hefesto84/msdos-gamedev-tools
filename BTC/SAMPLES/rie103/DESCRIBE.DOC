Short Description:
------------------

   Editor for creating/modifying custom EGA/VGA icons for TCXL.

Long Description:
-----------------

    Have you ever wanted to dress up the text-based programs you create with 
    graphic images, without actually going through the hassle of rewriting 
    your program for a graphics display mode?  With icons created by the 
    Rimrock Icon Editor (RIE), you can create 'pseudo-graphic' images that can 
    be displayed on an EGA or VGA display in text mode. 

    RIE allows you to graphically create a 16 bit by 32 bit icon, which is 
    stored in a C source file.  This information can then be used as 4 
    characters of 16 lines, which can be loaded as user-defined characters 
    into the display adapter.

    RIE was created primarily to support version 6 of TCXL, the TesSeRact C 
    eXtended Library (TCXL is copyright (C) 1987-92 by Innovative Data 
    Concepts).  However, the included ICONLOAD sample program will show you 
    how to load icons on your own. 

Registration Information:

   of RIE, all accompanying files, and a printed user's manual.  The
