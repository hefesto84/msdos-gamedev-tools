        DESCRIPTION
        This function uses the direct video access functions.
        dvid_init() must be called prior to using this function,
        and the functions may fail of the target system is not a
        very close compatible since direct memory writing is being
        used.  dvid_box() places a single line or double line box on the
        screen with the upper left corner anchored at "row" and "column",
        with the size denoted by the "height" and "width" values.
        No error checking is done on any value.  Invalid values may have
        unpredictable results.


        EXAMPLE

              int i;
              dvid_init();    /* initialize the package */
              dvid_cls();     /* clear the screen */
              dvid_box(0, 0, 80, 24, 1); /* border the entire screen */
                                         /* with double graphics line */



        CAVEAT:
              if a color attribute has been set before this call,
              it will revert to black & white if the "reverse video"
              outlines are selected.  The attribute is not changed
              for the normal video border selections.

        This function is found in SMTCx.LIB for the Turbo-C Compiler
