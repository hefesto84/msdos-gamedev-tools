       NAME
               mkbox -- make a box on the screen

       SYNOPSIS
               #include "graphics.h"
               void mkbox(startr, startc, width, ht, page);
               int startr;       starting row (top)
               int startc;       starting column (left)
               int width;        how many columns wide
               int ht;           how many rows high
               int page;         which video page (assuming
                                 proper video mode)

       DESCRIPTION
       This function will make a double line box using the IBM
       graphics characters on the "page" specified.  The "startr"
       and "startc" parameters anchor the upper left corner.  The
       "ht" and "width" set the dimensions.  No checks are made for
       valid numbers.  Function can be used with both CGA and Mono
       cards, and with EGA cards in CGA or MONO modes.

       EXAMPLE
              mkbox(0, 0, 80, 23, 0);
          will make a box around the outside of an 80 x 24 screen.



       CAVEAT
              if using the direct video access routines, use
              dvid_box() instead of this function.





       This function is found in SMTCx.LIB for the Turbo-C Compiler.
