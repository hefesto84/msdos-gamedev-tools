        NAME
                clrfield -- clear a screen field through BIOS
                disp_clrfield -- same, direct video access

        SYNOPSIS
                void clrfield(row, col, size, page);
                void disp_clrfield(row, col, size);
                int row, col;    starting point
                int size;        number of columns to clear ( <= 80)
                int page;        video page number
                                 (for non-CGA, specify 0)


        DESCRIPTION
        These functions handle the problem of clearing a section of
        a line on the screen without clearing to the end of the
        line.
        Both functions operate the same, except that clrfield()
        writes to stdout, and disp_clrfield() uses direct video access.
        In the latter case, the current screen attribute is used.
        Page number is not used in the direct mode.
        The field is cleared to ASCII spaces.
        If the size parameter is larger than 80, it is forced to 80.





        EXAMPLE

             clrfield(10, 20, 15, 0);  /* clear 15 columns on page 0
                                          starting at row 10, column 20 */
             disp_clrfield(10, 20, 15); /* same, direct video access */
