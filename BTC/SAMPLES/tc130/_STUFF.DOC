                _stuff -- get equipment report (low level)

        SYNOPSIS
                r = _stuff();
                int r;


        DESCRIPTION
        Returns an integer from DOS int 11H, indicating the
        available equipment and initial video mode.  This
        is a low level function.  For a higher level function,
        refer to stuff().
             bits 15, 14 = # of printers installed
             bit 12      = joystick installed if 1
             bits 11-9   = # of serial ports installed
             bits 7-6    = # of disk drives, 1-4 if bit 0 = 1
             bits 5-4    = Initial video mode:
                           01  40 x 25 b/w CGA
                           10  80 x 25 b/w CGA
                           11  80 x 25 Mono card
             bit 0       = no disk drives if 0


        EXAMPLE

                 int r;
                 r = _stuff();
                 /* test bit 12 (game port) */
                 if((r & 0x1000) != 0) printf("Game port installed");

        CAVEAT
                 Many clones return 0 as the number of installed
                 serial ports, even through Norton Utilities.
                 Therefore, a return of 0 serial ports may NOT
                 be telling the truth.  The reason for this anomaly
                 is not known.
