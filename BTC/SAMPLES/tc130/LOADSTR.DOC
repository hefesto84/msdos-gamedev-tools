                loadstr -- load a string with padding

        SYNOPSIS
                void loadstr(dest, source, qty);
                char *dest;       string destination
                char *source;     source string (NULL terminated)
                int qty;          bytes to place in destination


        DESCRIPTION
        This function is similar to strcat() in that it copies
        a source string to a destination string.  However,
        if the source string is smaller than "qty", the destination
        will be padded to the "qty" parameter with spaces.  In
        addition, the destination string will NOT be terminated
        by a NULL.  This is an unusual method of operation, but
        handy in some cases.






        EXAMPLE
           char title[] = "This is a title";
           char buffer[128];

           loadstr(buffer, title, 80);
           buffer[80] = NULL;         /* add terminator */
           puts(buffer);       /* message will be 80 characters long,
                               ** left justified */
