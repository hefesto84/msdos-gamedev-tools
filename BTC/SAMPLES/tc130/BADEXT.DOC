        DESCRIPTION
        This function may be used when an invalid filename extension must
        cause the termination of a program.  It is called with the
        offending extension as the argument string.  An error message
        is sent to stderr, and the program terminates via the aabort()
        function of this library.




















        This function is found in SMTCx.LIB for the Turbo-C Compiler.
