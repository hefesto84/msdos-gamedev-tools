        NAME
                center -- center a string

        SYNOPSIS
                r = center(string, size);
                int r;         starting column for centering
                char *string;  string to center
                int size;      width of field for centering


        DESCRIPTION
        This function returns the starting column to print a
        string for the string to be centered in a field of
        "size" characters.  For the screen, the width would
        usually be 80, and for printers, either 80 or 132.
        The string MUST NOT BE longer than the size specified,
        since there is no error cheking for this condition and
        an unusable result will be returned.



        EXAMPLE
           char title[] = "Title of Program";

           main() {
              int i;
              i = center(title, 80);
              d_say(2, i, title);     /* display title centered in row 2 */
              }
