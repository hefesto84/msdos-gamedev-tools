                iscons -- is file descriptor the console

        SYNOPSIS
                r = iscons(fd);
                int r;      TRUE or FALSE returned
                FILE *fd;   file descriptor to check


        DESCRIPTION
        The specified file descriptor is tested to see if it refers
        to the console device.  TRUE (not 0)
        is returned if it does, and FALSE (0) otherwise.
        This is a test primarily aimed at detecting if stdin or
        stdout have been redirected away from the default console.



        EXAMPLE
                if(iscons(stdin)) puts("stdin is the keyboard");
                else ("stdin is probably a file");
