        NAME
                chkdcd -- check state of carrier detect flag
                chkdsr -- check state of data set ready flag
                chkcts -- check state of clear to send flag
                chkring -- check state of ring indicator flag

        SYNOPSIS
                r = chkdcd(port);
                r = chkdsr(port);
                r = chkcts(port);
                r = chkring(port);
                int r;           TRUE or FALSE, depending upon state
                int port;        0, 1, 2, or 3 (for COM1-COM4)


        DESCRIPTION
        These are assembly language functions which provide direct
        access to the serial communications chips for the fastest
        access possible.  Each function checks a particular
        communications flag and returns its state as TRUE (on) or
        FALSE (off).
        The port parameter may be specified as integers 0-3, or
        SER1 to SER4 as defined in <smdefs.h>.



        EXAMPLE

            int sport;        /* serial port */

            sport = SER2;     /* let it point to COM2 */
            if(chkdcd(sport)) puts("We have a carrier detected");
            else puts("The modem is apparently idle");
