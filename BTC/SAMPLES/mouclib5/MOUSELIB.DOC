Introduction
------------

  mouseLib is a port of Loewy Ron's Turbo Pascal mouse support unit to C, 
 designed to provide event driven mouse support, using a standard (default) 
 event handling mechanism. The package includes all of the normal mouse API 
 functions, (show, hide cursor, define threshhold, detect mouse etc..). 
  mouseLib was ported by Cohen Ran, and distributed by permission.

Technical documantation
-----------------------

  We will not give any technical documentation but the supplied source code,
 We have tried to document the code as good as we could, we used the best names
 I could think of to functions and procedures, and added explanations where-
 ever we felt the code was not trivial. If you intend to use this package, you
 will have to look into the source code. 2 points we would like to mention - 
 a.> use the setMouseGraph and resetMouseGraph before using the initMouse
     procedure, to choose if you want text or graphics mouse support.
 b.> look at the defaultHandler assembler routine, this is the heart of my
     event driven applications. (use setDefaultHandler to ...).

Difference from Pascal version
------------------------------

  Because Turbo Pascal has the feature to execute unit initialization automatically
 no special procedure was supplied. This is not the case with the C version.
 Be sure to call function doMouse before you start to use any of the package
 functions!.

Warranty
--------

  There is no warranty what so ever, The unit and docs. are supplied as is,
 The authors (Loewy Ron and Cohen Ran), are not, and will not be responsible 
 for any damages, lost profits, or inconveniences caused by the use, 
 or inability to use this unit. The use of the unit is at your own risk. 
 By using the unit you agree to this.

General
-------

  mouseLib is copyrighted by (c) Loewy Ron, 1990, 1991. The C port of
 mouseLib is copyrighted by (c) Loewy Ron & Cohen Ran, 1991. We release
 the source, and it can be used for non-commercial programs, If you find
 mouseLib worthy, and plan to use it in a commercial product - please
 register mouseLib. (An order form is supplied - ORDER.TXT). Please notice,
 this package is reffered as mouCeLib in the ORDER.TXT, where mouseLib is the
 pascal version.

What mouseLib lacks
-------------------

  There is no TSR support, because our Genius Mouse reference did not mention
 INT 033H functions 014h, 015h etc.., We will sit down and write support for
 these functions some time, unless some one else will be kind enough to do that,
 and mail me the update. The new release adds functions to save and restore
 the mouse driver state (release 4) (functions 14 & 15), but there is still no
 tsr support (that will probably need func. 17 & 18 hex.)
