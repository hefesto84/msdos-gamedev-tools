PLSTEAL is a simple tsr program that grabs images. It works only for VGA mode
13h (320x200x256) and it needs mouse. PLSTEAL save the images as STEALxxx.BIN
in the output directory. xxx is any number between 1 and 999. The format of
those files is very simple:
 The first word is the length of the image (len), the
 second is the height of the image (hei) and the next
 len*hei bytes are the RAW data of the image.
PLSTEAL will only be enabled if there is a mouse and the VGA card is in mode
13h. After PLSTEAL is enabled through the "hotkey" a grab box will be
displayed on the screen:

To move the grab box:            move the mouse
to resize the grab box:          press the left mouse button, keep it down
                                 and move the mouse
to save the image:               press the right mouse button.
                                 Each time an image is saved the
                                 "next file number" counter increases
to save the palette:             press ALT+P
                                 a palette file STEALxxx.PAL
                                 will be created in the output directory
to resize the grab box
at size 16x16:                   press t
to freeze the grab box:          press f, press f again to unfreeze the
                                 grab box. If the grab box is
                                 freezed you cannot move it.
to exit from PLSTEAL             press ESC

There are also some parameters when you call PLSTEAL from command line:
/d=<dirname>        specifies the output directory
                    all files PLSTEAL creates are put there.
                    The default is the current directory.
/nxxx               changes the "next file number" counter to xxx, xxx is
                    any number between 1 and 999. For example if xxx is
                    123 the next file that will be created by PLSTEAL
                    will be named STEAL123.BIN (or STEAL123.PAL)
/hx                 defines the hotkey. x can take the following values:
                    1:   CTRL+ALT+I
                    2:   LEFT SHIFT+ALT+R
                    3:   LEFT SHIFT+RIGHT SHIFT+K
                    4:   ALT+G
                    the default is 4 (ALT+G)
/u                  uninstalls PLSTEAL if possible.

example:
 PLSTEAL  /d=c:\images\bin /n100 /h3
