                   History of PLATFORMTRON game library

version 0.1  August 1995    (never released)
  The first try to develop a game library. It was coded
  in Turbo Pascal, but it was buggy and could not do many 
  things. Only a simple layer was supported and very simple sprite
  manipulations. The programmer's interface was bad. 
  I abandoded the project.

version 0.3  December 1995  (never released)
  PLATFOMRTON was redesigned and ported to C++. This 
  version could do as much as version 0.1

version 0.5  March 1996   (never released)
  Support for one more layer was added. A very simple keyboard handler
  and timer handler was coded too. I also started coding the object lists
  support routines and got the idea of priority lists.

version 0.8  August 1996  (never released)
  The first good version. sprintfdescr() and many other miscellaneous 
  functions were added. Also that was the first version that could cooperate
  with a music library. It ran well under dos.
   
version 1.00 January 1997 (this version)
  I discovered that version 0.8 din't run under windows 95. The keyboard
  handler could hang the system. Also there were problems with the screen 
  refreshing when the program was again in foreground. One other problem was
  that the animation speed was not the same under dos and windows.
  I corrected all of these problems in this version and added EMS support for
  the bitmaps. Now it is your turn to find bugs :-). 

next version.
  I will try to port PLATFORMTRON to Watcom C++.
