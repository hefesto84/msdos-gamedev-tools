Before try to register please read LICENSE.TXT.

Why you should register:

- It is the only way to become a legal user of PLATFORMTRON game library.
- You pay a lot less than you get.
- You will get great discounts in the future versions of PLATFORMTRON.
  ( i am currently trying to port PLATFORMTRON in Watcom c/c++ )
- You will be able to get free a level editor (when i finish and release it).
- You will encourage me to work with greatest enthusiasm and give you
  more quality products like this in the future.

The version of PLATFORMTRON game library you have in your hands is a
full-featured version. So, I will not send you another version if you
register. That way there is no surcharge for shipping and handling and
I dont spend my time sending diskettes to you. Thus PLATFORMTRON is even
cheaper for you.
