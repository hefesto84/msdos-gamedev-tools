TCU Database Option
===================


The TCU database option to TCU version 3.2 is designed to extend the
TCU form services by providing a means of creating databases of form
records.  Records may be quickly located, added, deleted, updated,
etc.

This option installs itself into the existing TCU 3.2 installation.
If you do not currently have TCU 3.2, this option should not be
installed.

The database option contains a installation program very like that
supplied with TCU 3.2.  In order to install the database option the
following simple steps should be taken.

  1.  Copy all files from the distribution archive, TCU_DB.ZIP,
      into a temporary directory.

  2.  Move into the temporary directory now containing the files
      from the archive and execute the program TCUDBINS.

  3.  Complete the installation using the installation program.

  4.  You may now delete the files in the temporary directory and
      the directory itself.  The TCU database option will now be
      installed.



dBASE III+ Databases
--------------------

A utility program is provided to convert dBASE III+ databases into
TCU database format.  Note that dBASE indices are not used, but may
be specified new with the import program, DB3TOTCU.  In order to
perform the import, a TCU form file must be created which contains
AT LEAST the fields from the dBASE database.  The dBASE field names
must be the same as the names given to the fields in the TCU form
file.  dBASE field names which are longer than 8 characters are
truncated to 8 characters during the import, e.g. a dBASE field with
the name FIRST_NAME must match a TCU form field with the name FIRST_NA.

When the form has been created, it should be compiled using the TCU
forms compiler, FCOMP to a .CFO file.  Execute the DB3TOTCU utility
with the parameters:

  db3totcu <dBASE file name> <TCU form name> <TCU DB name>

An example database and form is provided to go with the example
program.  To compile the form and generate the TCU database required
by the example, perform the following:

  \> fcomp dbform
  \> db3totcu demo_db dbform demo_db

You may then execute the DBDEMO example program which you must first
compile.

If possible, send your problem in program form on a diskette so that
it can be examined more quickly, reliably and easily.  The disk will
be returned to you with the answer, a patch if necessary and the
latest version of TCU (if a 1.44 MB disk is sent).
