TC-TSR10.ZIP README FILE

Tc-tsr10.zip contain a group of tsr-related programs written in turbo C.
These files are intended as examples rather than robust utilities. However,
having said that, I've been (happily :-)) using them for some time now. In any
case, if you make any improvements, or fix some bugs please let me (Sherif)
know.

All the files contained here are public domain, and are not copyrighted. I
Hope they will be useful, but,

     The author shall not be liable to the user for any direct, indirect or    
     consequential loss arising from the use of, or inability to use, any    
     program or file howsoever caused. No warranty is given that the programs
     will work under all circumstances.

PRTSC.C, and
TSRPRTSC.C     make up an example popup-TSR for saving and printing screens in
               text mode.
PRTSC.TXT      some documentation on PRTSC.

PRT2DISK.C     an example TSR which redirects printer output (lpt1) to a disk
               file.
FLUSH.COM      for flushing data left in prt2disk's buffer (should be used to
               ensure that all data is written to the disk file).

               to create FLUSH.COM.
