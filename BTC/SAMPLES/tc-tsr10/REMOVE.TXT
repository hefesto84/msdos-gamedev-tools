SAVEINTS/REMOVE

SAVEINTS and REMOVE are two utilities that can be used to remove TSRs from
memory.

SAVEINTS saves a picture of the interrupt table to a disk file. It takes one
command line argument which is the file name.

Example:
C> saveints c:\intfile

REMOVE removes a TSR. It takes two command line arguments. The first is the
name of TSR to be removed (or an * to remove the last one), and the second is
a file name which MUST contain the interrupt vectors to be loaded when the TSR
is removed.

REMOVE is simple and far from perfect (it works well for me :-), however). I
think it might be useful as a learning tool, since it is available as C source
code. It also has the advantage of not being a TSR!

If you make any improvements please let me know about them.

The files compile with Turbo C 2.0, and you need DOS 3.0 or later to support
removal of programs by name, otherwise you can simply use an * instead of the
program name.

Example:

C> saveints c:\intfile     | save interrupt table to file c:\intfile
C> X                       | load TSR X
C> Y                       | load TSR Y
...                        |
C> remove Y.COM c:\intfile | remove Y.COM and restore ints
                           | from c:\intfile. At this point
                           | X can't be used !! because
                           | intfile was saved before X
                           | was loaded !!.
C> remove X.com c:\intfile | but at least you can still remove X.com :-)

Hope that's useful, but,
