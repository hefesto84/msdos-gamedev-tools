October, 1987

This diskette contains the source and exe files for the programs in 
"Turbo C: Memory-Resident Utilities, Screen I/O, and Advanced 
Programming Techniques", Al Stevens, 1987, MIS:Press.

This book uses the unique features of Turbo C to implement a complete
video window package. The package includes support for context-sensitive
help, pop-down menus, data entry templates, and a window text editor.

The book also explains the concepts of Terminate-and-Stay-Resident 
(TSR) utility programs under DOS. Example TSR programs are provided, and 
a TSR driver program is included that allows you to build your own TSR
programs in Turbo C.

There are differences between the files here and the listings in the book
As published, clock.c only works properly when compiled	with the tiny 
memory model. The clock.c program on this diskette can be compiled with 
either the tiny or small memory model. The files twindow.c and twindow.h 
in the book have a bug that prevents compiling when FASTWINDOWS is defined.
The bug is corrected in the files on this diskette.
