Subject: PC printer port bi-directional driver

This archive contains the code needed to drive PC parallel ports.  It was
written as part of our Printer Nidget development project.  I have been
able to drive over 30k/second from a 16 mhz 386 using the test routines
built in.  Inspiration came from John Foster at Annabooks who has an
EXCELLENT PC and AT bios available in C source.  For about $60, highly
recommended. 

This code is written for Borland C and includes a project file.

Enjoy,
John
