                      DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

      Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
   before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
   using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
   differ on details -- some request registration while others
   require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
   registration, you get anything from the simple right to 
   continue using the software to an updated program with printed 
   manual.

      Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial 
   software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a 
   few specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are 
   accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors, and the 
   programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are 
   good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the 
   method of distribution. The author specifically grants the 
   right to copy and distribute the software, either to all and 
   sundry or to a specific group. For example, some authors 
   require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may 
   copy their Shareware.

      Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. 
   You should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
   whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system 
   makes fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you 
   buy. And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. 
   Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't 
   use the product, you don't pay for it.

     PLEASE!  Show your support for Shareware by registering the
     programs you actually use.  Simply Soft depends upon and
     needs your support.  Thank you!
