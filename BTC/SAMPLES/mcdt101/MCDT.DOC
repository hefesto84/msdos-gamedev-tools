			USING THE MOUSE CURSOR DESIGN TOOL


The Mouse Cursor Design Tool requires at least an EGA graphics card that can
display 16 colors simultaneously and a Microsoft-compatible mouse.

The mouse cursor design tool is very easy to use.  It has a built-in help
feature that allows you to get help on any specific function you desire.
To access this feature, click on the Help button, then click on any control
panel button or area on the screen you would like help with.

It would be a good idea to go through all of the important screen areas, as
well as all of the control panel buttons using the help facility before you
start designing cursors.  This way, you will be familiar with what the program
does and what each control panel button can do for you.  Then, once you have
a good idea about the program, you can get to work designing custom mouse
cursors!

You may use these cursors in any of your applications, including programs
that you recieve renumeration for, provided you have the registered version
of this program.  To find out how to register, as well as all of the things
you will recieve as a registered user, please read the file ORDER.ME.
