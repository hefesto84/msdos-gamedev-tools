Blit, copyright 1988, Russell Nelson

Use it; pass it on; but don't make any money off of it.

Blit is a routine to copy a rectangle of bits from one location to
another.  The only language binding is Turbo C, however, MS-C ought to
work, since it's largely Turbo C compatible.  The algorithm was inspired
by Rob Pike's implementation of blit documented in Software-Practice and
Experience, Vol. 15(2), 131-151 (February 1985)].  If you want to know
more about how blit operates then see Byte Magazine, August 1981, p.
168-194.  See the example code, bt.c, for a sample way to call blit.

Interpreting the verbs:

The following charts show how the various verbs combine the src and dest
bits.  Obviously, there are sixteen possibilities, only seven of which
are implemented.  The rest are easy to do, I just never bothered.


or1_verb (not implemented) - or the source with the not of the destination.

		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   0
		     1 | 1   1


xnor_verb (not implemented) - exclusive nor the source and destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   0
		     1 | 0   1


nor_verb (not implemented) - nor the source and the destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   1
		     1 | 1   0


and1_verb (not implemented) - and the source with the not of the destination.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   0
		     1 | 1   0


nand_verb (not implemented) - nand the source and the destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   0
		     1 | 0   0


zeroes_verb (not implemented) - zeroes the destination bitmap.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   0
		     1 | 0   0


ones_verb (not implemented) - sets the destination bitmap to ones.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   1
		     1 | 1   1


nop_verb (not implemented) - do nothing.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   1
		     1 | 0   1


invert_verb (not implemented) - invert the destination bitmap.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   0
		     1 | 1   0


pset_verb - copy the source to the destination.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   0
		     1 | 1   1


preset_verb - copy the inverse of the source to the destination.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   1
		     1 | 0   0


and_verb - and the source and destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   0
		     1 | 0   1


and_not_verb - and the destination with the not of the source.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   1
		     1 | 0   0


or_verb - or the source and destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   1
		     1 | 1   1
or_not_verb - or the destination with the not of the source.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 1   1
		     1 | 0   1
xor_verb - exclusive or the source and destination together.
		         dest
		       | 0   1
		   -----------
		src  0 | 0   1
		     1 | 1   0
