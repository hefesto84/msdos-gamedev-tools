===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

    The Simpsoft Inc. product line has been three years in the
  making. We were tired of of stack overflow, out of memory 
  errors, and that madding search for that lost open file or 
  hidden overstrike. So we decided to write a small static 
  utility library in C/C++ that would take care of all that. Three 
  years later, Simply Soft gave birth to Simple Windows and the 
  rest of the Simply Soft family.
    Simply Soft is a DOS development and utility company aimed 
  at the shareware developer. It is economical and user friendly. 
  We have Five shareware and one free product at this time. All 
  products are under $51 ,most are under $26 if not free 
  (free, that's cheap), and a discount of 25% on Full Pack 1.1,  
  all four utilities (Simply Windows 1.8, Font Edit 1.6, 
  VGA Edit 1.4, and Simple Mouse 2.4). A $125 value for $100.
  Registration gets phone support (24 hour answering machine), 
  email, and Discounts on upgrades are also offered. So check out 
  your stuff and drop us a line.

                                      Sincerely,
                                      Bruce R. O'Banion

   Installation is easy just unzip SIMPWN18.ZIP and from that 
directory or disk type install at the prompt. Then follow the
instructions. Simple Windows can be deinstalled just as easy. 
Again use install.exe from the distribution disk or if zipped 
unzip to a temp directory and run from there. Simpwin.doc can be 
read or printed with readocs.exe. It is a text file reader/printer 
and will read or print a text file.

  This program and utility were compiled on a 386 clonewith the 
286 instruction set. It requires a 286 PC or compatible DOS 4.1
or higher, and MS mouse, and EGA or higher (VGA for some 
functions). And a 9 pin dot matrix is needed to print the docs.

===== License for Use and Distribution =================

                      DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE

      Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
   before buying it. If you try a Shareware program and continue
   using it, you are expected to register. Individual programs
   differ on details -- some request registration while others
   require it, some specify a maximum trial period. With
   registration, you get anything from the simple right to 
   continue using the software to an updated program with printed 
   manual.

      Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial 
   software, and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a 
   few specific exceptions as stated below. Shareware authors are 
   accomplished programmers, just like commercial authors, and the 
   programs are of comparable quality. (In both cases, there are 
   good programs and bad ones!) The main difference is in the 
   method of distribution. The author specifically grants the
   right to copy and distribute the software, either to all and 
   sundry or to a specific group. For example, some authors 
   require written permission before a commercial disk vendor may 
   copy their Shareware.

      Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software. 
   You should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook,
   whether it's commercial or Shareware. The Shareware system 
   makes fitting your needs easier, because you can try before you 
   buy. And because the overhead is low, prices are low also. 
   Shareware has the ultimate money-back guarantee -- if you don't 
   use the product, you don't pay for it.

     PLEASE!  Show your support for Shareware by registering the
     programs you actually use.  Simpsoft Inc. depends upon and
     needs your support.  Thank you!

useable by automated tools.  The data record allows BBSes and other
distributors to automate package handling, and provides users with a
wealth of product information.  VENDINFO tools (free viewer for users,
free or inexpensive processors for distributors, editors for authors)
are available from many sources, including the originators of VENDINFO:
