Included here is a quick-and-dirty reference guide to the library functions
in Turbo C version 1.0.  Some functions, such as string functions, are 
collected under one heading, such as "str..." or "exec...".

TCHELP.EXE is a Turbo C program to search the reference guide (TC.DAT)
for the function, and display the information about it to the console.
TCHELP.C is a Turbo C version of R.E.Sawyer's ABOUT.C routine, revised
for Turbo C.

Contributions are always welcome.  Please send any revisions to TC.DAT as
well to:
