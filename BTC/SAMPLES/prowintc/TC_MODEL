                      Copyright 1988  Daniel P. Stasinski


                       For Borland's Turbo C Users Only

         You have just obtained a copy of ProWindows *LITE*.  This
         version is intended for use with Borland's 'Turbo C' only.
         Other versions are available for Borland's 'Turbo Pascal' and
         Microsoft's 'QuickBASIC'.

         The 'Turbo C' version will compile under the SMALL memory
         model only.  These routines access memory in the far heap so
         you should never attempt to compile in the TINY model.

         To compile a stand alone program, you need to create a 'Turbo
         C' project file.  A project file is a ASCII files that
         contains the names of all files that need to compiled and
         linked into your program.

         Your "Turbo C Reference Guide' describes in detail, methods
         of creating project files.
