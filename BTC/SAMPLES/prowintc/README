         Hello;

               Welcome to the world of "ProWindows", the ultimate
         professional software development system.

              "ProWindows" began it's life in the winter of 1987.  It
         was originally intended to be an in-house program, and used
         for the development of my own commercial software projects.
         But since that time, I have decided to release almost every
         part of it to the commercial market.

              The version you have now, "*LITE* - Version 2.00", is
         the heart of the entire "ProWindows" line of products.  The
         "ProWindows" WLS (Window Logic System) does all the house
         keeping for you.  You need not worry about allocating memory,
         saving existing screens, or coordinating printing.  The WLS
         takes care of it all.

              The "ProWindows" WLS is destined to become the standard
         in "Pop Up" window management systems, and I am sure that is
         why several major developers are relying upon this product
         for all of their future software development needs.  Maybe
         you should too.

              Just think, for $7.50 (the cost of a tremendous cup of
         coffee) you can own, ROYALTY FREE, what serious developers
         are relying upon.  Or, for $15.00, (two tremendous cups of
         coffee), you can get "*LITE* - Version 3.00".  It has 30 more
         window styles, 10 more useful functions, creates smaller
         executable files, and still there are NO ROYALTIES.  Oh yes,
         it also comes with a coupon for a $10.00 discount when you
         decide to purchase "ProWindows *PLUS*".  Send it in NOW.

              "ProWindows *PLUS*" is scheduled to be released
         commercially on October 15, 1988.  I believe that it is the
         most advanced software development system there is.  I doubt
         that you will find a program, at any price, that compares to
         it.  And considering the price is only $34.95 + $5.00 S/H, I
         doubt that you ever will.  Read the included documentation
         for more information.

              Please take some time now to fill out your registration
         form.  Mail it to me with a check or money order for $7.50
         (or $15.00 for Version 3.00) to become a registered owner of
         "ProWindows *LITE*".  It took me over 1 year to do my part
         but it should only take you a few moments to do yours.

              Thank you for your continued support,





              Daniel P. Stasinski
