         "PRODEMO.EXE" demonstrates every function of "ProWindows
         *LITE* - Version 2.00" and many of the enhanced features of
         "*LITE* -Version 3.00".

         When invoked as:

              PRODEMO <CR>

         the demonstration run in its default mode of no `Snow'
         detection.  `Snow' is cause when the CGA adaptor tries to
         address video memory at the same time the CPU wants to.  This
         usually occurs on old IBM CGA cards.  Most newer cards do not
         have this problem.

         Needless to say, if you experience a snowy screen, press
         [ESCape] (to exit the demo) and re-invoke the program as:

              PRODEMO 1 <CR>

         Snow will be suppressed.


         If at any point you would like to pause the demonstration,
         press 'P'.  Execution will stop until you press a different
         key.
