This package contains routines for communication between two computers 
via the parallel printer ports. Routines are written in Turbo-C, with 
inline assembler. Data transfer requires a cable with the same pinout as 
the DOS 6 Interlink program. Specifications for this are given in the 
comments at the top of PPORT.C

List of files:
    PPORT.C             Turbo-C routines for port initialization and                         
                        4-bit transfers via the printer port.
    PPORT.H             Header file for above

    CLIENT.C            A simple file transfer system, illustrating use
    SERVER.C            of the above routines.
    CLIENT.EXE          Compiled versions of the above. These may be     
    SERVER.EXE          useful if you don't have DOS 6. If you do, 
                        Interlink will do more for you more easily.



DISCLAIMER:
    The author accepts no liability for any damages to users or to third 
parties, arising in any way out of the use of these routines. USE AT YOUR
OWN RISK.
    Do not expect support if you are using an unlicensed version. I am 
always interested in bug reports, however, and any major ones will
probably get fixed.
