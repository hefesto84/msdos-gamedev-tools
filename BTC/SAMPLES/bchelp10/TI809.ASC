    TITLE  :  Using CPP to Resolve Mysterious Compiler Errors




  The preprocessor CPP.EXE can be used when you are not sure how
  #include is working, how #define macros are being expanded or how
  the various #if directives are being evaluated, among other
  things.  The default CPP output file name will be the same name
  as the input source file with a .I extension.

  The output from CPP is often useful when you are getting error
  messages during compilation and the reason is not clear when
  viewing the source code. If your source code contains complex
  macros that take several arguments CPP will show you exactly what
  the final expansion will be, which can also be helpful when
  trying to find the source of a subtle problem.
