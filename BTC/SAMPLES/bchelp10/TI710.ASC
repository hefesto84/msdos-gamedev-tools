    TITLE  :  WINDOWS:  CreateDialog Failure











  CreateDialog will fail if the resource being used has an
  undefined element.  For example, in the call:

  CreateDialog (inst, DB, hwnd, func);

  if DB is a resource that has an undefined element, such as a menu
  that is declared but undefined, the CreateDialog call will fail.
