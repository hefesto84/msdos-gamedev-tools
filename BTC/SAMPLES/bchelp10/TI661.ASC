    TITLE  :  Windows CALLBACK Must Be Exported




  All callback functions must be exported (unless you  use  the -WS
  Smart Callbacks option).  You can either export  via  the _export
  keyword in the function definition (i.e., on the prototype if one
  is present) or by listing the function in the EXPORTS  section of
  the .def file.

  Following are the appropriate  command  line  options (in the IDE
  under  menu Options | Compiler | Entry/Exit Code):

     1.  If function definition includes keyword _export
         a. -W (Windows all functions exportable)
         b. -WE (Windows explicit function exported)

     2.  If function listed in .def file
         a. -W (Windows all functions exportable)

     3.  Compile with -WS (Windows Smart Callbacks)
         {won't work when building DLL's, see documentation for
          special effects of this option}

     4.  For building DLL's, use:
          a. -WD (Windows DLL all functions exportable)
          b. -WDE (Windows DLL explicit functions exported)
