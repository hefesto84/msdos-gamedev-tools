   TITLE  : -G PATCH




  The  following  patch  solves a problem  in  Turbo  C  where  the
  compiler can run out of memory compiling a large switch statement
  if the -G option is used.

  To  apply  this  patch,  use  the DOS utility DEBUG.COM. You  may
  obtain a copy of DEBUG.COM from one of your  original  PC-DOS  or
  MS-DOS diskettes.

  NOTE:
  1.   Do not patch your original Turbo C disk, use  a  working  or
       backup copy of TCC.EXE and TC.EXE for this patch.

  2.   DEBUG  is  not  sensitive  to  upper  and  lower  case.  All
       addresses are listed in upper case for ease of readibility.

  3.   XXXX,YYYY,ZZZZ are hexidecimal digits returned by DEBUG. You
       must replace these digits accordingly  when  typing  in your
       commands.

  4.   While in DEBUG, the prompt will appear as a dash (-).

  5.   If you do not  receive  the  appropriate  response,press "q"
       followed by  <Enter>, to exit from DEBUG. Check your version
       number and, if correct, try again.

  6.   TCC.EXE and TC.EXE will not fit together onto  a  360K disk.
       To patch both  programs  on  a  floppy disk, you may need to
       copy TCC.EXE and DEBUG.COM onto  one  disk  and  perform the
       patch. Save  the patched version of TCC.EXE to another disk.
       Repeat the same steps using TC.EXE.

  At  the DOS prompt, type the  following  information  exactly  as
  itappears (Conclude each line by pressing <Enter>).
