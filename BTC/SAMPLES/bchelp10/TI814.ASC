    TITLE  :  Using the Evaluate Dialog Box in the IDE




  The IDE debugger's Evaluate/Modify dialog box can do a great deal
  more than simply show the value of a variable; it can evaluate
  any expression that is valid in a C/C++ program (with a few
  exceptions).

  This includes complicated expressions as well as simply serving
  as a handy programmer's calculator.  For example, if you want a
  quick conversion of hex to decimal or vice versa, and you have
  set Options | Display Options | Integer Format to 'both', you can
  simply type in the number you wish to convert and 'Evaluate' it.
  Or suppose that at particular point in your program, a variable
  does not have the value it should, but you want to continue with
  the correct value -- simply change it and go on, making a note of
  whatever problem caused the original inconsistency so you can
  correct things later.

  The Evaluate/Modify dialog box has limitations that should be
  observed as well. It cannot execute functions although the
  stand-alone debugger available with the "Turbo Debugger and
  Tools" product can.  Neither can it change the value of an entire
  structure or class at once, although individual data members can
  be changed.  Be careful when changing memory locations since the
  debugger has no way of knowing a safe memory location from a
  dangerous one.  And, as mentioned above, pre- processor symbols
  are unknown to the debugger, and thus are not available for use
  by the evaluation dialog box.
