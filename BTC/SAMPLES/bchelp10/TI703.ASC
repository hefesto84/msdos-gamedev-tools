    TITLE  :  "Automatic Data Segment Exceeds 64K" at Link Time








  The Automatic Data Segment (ADS) consists of the DGROUP data
  segment, the size of the local heap and the size of the stack.
  The size of the local heap and stack are controlled by the
  HEAPSIZE and STACKSIZE keywords in the module definition file
  (.def file).  The size of the DGROUP, however, is controlled by
  the amount of static initialized and uninitialized data.  To see
  where all the space in DGROUP is going, use a detailed segment
  map (TLINK's /s option or BCC's -ls option) and look in the
  detailed segment section for all segments and modules
  contributing to DGROUP.  (They will be marked "G=DGROUP.")

  To resolve such errors, you will need to reduce stack size and/or
  heap size allocations in the application DEF file, make some data
  far or reduce your near data usage.
