    TITLE  :  Initializing Static Class Members of Type Class




  /* IMPORTANT! When testing static member initialization, you must
     declare an instance of the class in a main function; otherwise, the
     linker has no reference which it must try to resolve, and the
     undefined symbol error will not be seen--thus you won't know that
     your initialization was in error.
  */

  //declare a class
  class First {
    public:
      int count;
      First() {}  //must have callable constructor
  };

  //declare class containing static member of class First
  class Second {
    public:
      static First fVar;
  };

  //initialize static member of class Second
  First Second::fVar = First();  //initialize with explicit call to ctor

  int main(void)
  {
    Second *sVarA = new Second;
    delete sVarA;
    return 0;
