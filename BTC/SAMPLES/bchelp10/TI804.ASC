    TITLE  :  Spawning a batch (.bat) file




  To spawn a batch file, you must spawn the command processor with
  the batch file as an argument.  For example:

      spawnl(P_WAIT, "c:\\command.com",
          "c:\\command.com","/c", "file.bat", NULL);

  This example will spawn command.com assuming it is located in the
  root directory of drive C and then tell command.com to execute a
  batch file called file.bat!
