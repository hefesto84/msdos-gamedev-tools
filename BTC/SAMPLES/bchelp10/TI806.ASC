    TITLE  :  Configuring Turbo C++ for Use from a Network




  Although Turbo C++ is not qualified for use ON a network, it is
  possible to run Turbo C++ FROM a network.  That is to say, it not
  possible to run Turbo C entirely on a network; there MUST be a
  drive at the user's station and any disk I/O must be forced to
  occur to the local drive.

  Since Turbo C++ always seems to write to the BIN of its
  installation, one might wonder how this can be accomplished.  The
  following steps outline the procedure.

      1)  Implement the procedure titled "Save State of Last Exit
          on a By-Directory Basis" which appears earlier in this
          section. This will force the IDE to write desktop,
          configuration and project    information to the logged
          (read local) directory rather than the network directory.

      2)  When you execute the IDE, use the command:

              TC /rX<Enter>

          where 'X' is the drive letter of a local drive.  This
          will force TC++ to use the specified local drive for its
          swap file rather than the network drive. Note that the
          above command should be supplemented with the options you
          normally use.
