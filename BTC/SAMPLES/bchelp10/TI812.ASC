    TITLE  :  What Causes "Abnormal Program Termination"




  The startup code does several things before going to the main()
  function.  If any one of these fails, it will abort and display
  the "Abnormal Program Termination" message; this message is
  printed whenever the function abort() is invoked.

  The startup code will abort if:

      (1) There is not enough memory to load the program.

          Workaround: Free up memory begore running program.
                      clean out system, run from DOS, not
                      environment.

      (2) There is not enough memory to expand the stack.

          Workaround: As above, reduce the stack size.

      (3) If environment space is bad, TC checks the environment,
          user has probable overwrote lower memory prior to trying
          to load program.

      (4) If EMU cannot initilize. The EMU needs to take some space
          of the stack, if the stack isn't big enough, program will
          abort.

      (5) If overlay system cannot initilize. Usually memory
          problem.

      (6) If there is not enough heapspace.

  Notice that in most cases, the problem is a lack of memory.

  One possible solution may arise if the person is working from the
  Turbo C++ Programmers Platform.  The PP takes all of the memory
  in the system when in runs.  When you want to run one of your
  programs from inside the PP, memory is freed to the total of the
  size of the load image of your program + 64K by default.  This
  amount can be changed through Options|Debugger|Program Heap Size.
  Try setting this value to a higher value and attempt to run the
  program again.
