    TITLE  :  Problem Closing an MDI Application?






  PROBLEM:  Attempts to close an MDI application from a menu while
            the MDI application is iconized fail.



  SOLUTION: An icon is actually two windows--the normal icon and an
            "icon title" window which is owned by the system, not
            by the application. When an MDIDESTROY message is sent
            to an iconized MDI window, the icon (ie, the window) is
            destroyed, but the title window is only hidden, not
            destroyed.  The solution is to send the icon a
            WM_MDIRESTORE message, and then a WM_MDIDESTROY.  If
            you don't want this to be visible, call
            ShowWindow(hWnd, SW_HIDE) to hide the window first.
