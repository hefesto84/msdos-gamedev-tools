    TITLE  :  DOS 5.0 and Borland Language Products





  DOS 5 brings a new level of memory management technology to PC's.
  Along with this new technology comes a higher degree of technical
  complexity, requiring more knowledge in making DOS 5 work with
  pre-DOS 5 software and hardware. Fortunately, most DOS 5 issues
  are easily solved.

  The shipping versions of our C/C++ language products and Turbo
  Debugger & Tools are essentially compatible with DOS 5. There
  are, however, several issues one needs to be aware of when using
  protected mode versions of our products in conjunction with DOS
  5.


  BCX, BCCX, TLINKX, TD286

  To make DOS 5 and EMM386 work properly with BCX and the other
  products listed above, you need to use emm386.sys in the
  following fashion:

  device = dos\emm386.exe ram XXXX

  where XXXX is the amount of EMS to allocate. There seems to be an
  approximate 1-1 correlation between EMS allocated and extended
  memory available to BCX.  So a value >= 800K for EMS would be
  appropriate.  Basically, we are "reserving" memory for use by
  TKERNEL, which is Borland's DOS extender kernel loaded
  automatically by BCX, BCCX, TLINKX, and TD286. Specifying 'ram
  64' can cause a system reboot, and 'ram 256' will produce an
  insufficient memory error similar to the one below:

  System: Insufficient Memory To Load Task
  Error : Cannot Create Task

  The 'frame=none' option doesn't solve any problems, giving errors
  when EMSTEST is run and causing a reboot when File|Get Info is
  selected when running BCX. It isn't really advisable to use
  'frame=none' with our products.

  Note that tests used EMM386 in conjunction with himem.sys and
  "dos=high,umb".

  TD386, TF386

  TD386 versions prior to 2.51 will not operate properly with DOS
  5. If you have version 2.0+ of Turbo Debugger, TD386 2.51 is
  available on our download BBS (408.439.9181) as well as on
  Compuserve and BIX. The file name for the download BBS is
  "TD386.ZIP." If you have a version of Turbo Debugger prior to
  2.0, you'll need to upgrade to the latest version.

  TD386 2.51 will not work with DOS 5.0 when either EMM386 or
  DOS=HIGH is used in config.sys. EMM386 puts the processor into
  V86 (virtual-86) mode and poses the same problem as QEMM or 386-
  to-the-Max in that TDH386 needs to control the processor.

  DOS=HIGH causes another unexplained problem that Borland is
  currently investigating. The problem is manifested by TD386
  appearing to load and then failing to load all the way, causing
  the computer to lock up.

  TF386 on some systems causes the computer to lock up when you
  load an application and then hit Alt-X to quit. The causes of
  this behavior are still being investigated. For now, test TF386
  on your system for compatibility. If you have a problem, report
  it to Borland through our online services (Compuserve, BIX, and
  Genie) or through technical support (408.438.5300).


  MAKE

  MAKE has been reported to hang on some systems with DOS 5.0 using
  the .SWAP directive within MAKE. Removing the .SWAP has solved
  the problem on all systems reporting difficulties.


  BCX and QEMM

  When you are using EMM386, Windows will no longer work in
  Standard Mode, thus preventing a person from running BCX and
  Windows simultaneously. However, if you use QEMM-386 (a memory
  management product from Quarterdeck Software), you can run
  Windows in Standard Mode without a problem, thus gaining
  significant flexibility. QEMM-386 will also work with "dos=high"
  and "devicehigh" without any apparent problems. QEMM-386 also

  seems to be more efficient than EMM386 in loading resident
  programs up into upper memory blocks as well as offering more
  options for custom configuration. Furthermore, QEMM-386 takes
  approximately 7K less memory below 640K than DOS 5's HIMEM/EMM386
  combination. For many uses, QEMM offers a superior solution to
  memory management rather than using DOS 5's HIMEM and EMM386
  utilities.


  DOS 5.0 and Windows 386 Enhanced Mode and BC++

  DOS 5.0 includes the ability to load device drivers and TSR's
  above 640K to free up more memory to applications. This ability
  is very useful under Windows 3.0 when running BC++ (BC.EXE) in
  386 Enhanced Mode. Under DOS 5.0, you can achieve a DOS box with
  600K+ of available memory which can dramatically speed up BC++
  compile/link times, approaching BCX compile/link times for small
  to medium input files. The overall strategy for those people
  running BC++ under 386 Enhanced Windows is to maximize the amount
  of memory available in a DOS box so that BC++ will have more
  memory to work with before it has to swap to EMS or to disk. Be
  sure to "lock" your application and EMS memory in your PIF file,
  just as before DOS 5.0.


  Other Incompatibilities

  DOS 5 has been reported to cause conflicts with certain mouse
  drivers, device drivers, BIOS versions and TSR's. Many times a
  perceived problem with Borland products is not due to a direct
  incompatibility but a side effect of an incompatibility with
  another product. When trying to determine if there is an
  incompatibility between your system, DOS 5 and our products, try
  booting with a config.sys and autoexec.bat similar to those shown
  below:

  config.sys

  files=20
  buffers=20
