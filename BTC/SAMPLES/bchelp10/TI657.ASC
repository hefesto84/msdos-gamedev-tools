    TITLE  :  Linking a Windows Application from the Command Line




  The syntax for TLINK is:

          TLINK objfiles,exefile,mapfile,libfiles,deffile

  You  must  always use the /Tw option  to  create  a  Windows  EXE
  or  DLL.   Use /Twe or /Twd  to  specifically  create  a  Windows
  EXE  or  DLL,  respectively.  The  last   two   options  override
  specifications in the DEF file.

  There is a specific  startup  module  to  use with Windows EXE's;
  it is C0Wx.OBJ.  For DLL's it is C0Dx.OBJ.

  The  required  libraries  are:  IMPORT.LIB, CWINx.LIB,  MATHx.LIB
  and  Cx.LIB.  For DLL's the Windows library  for  the  small  and
  compact models is  CWINC.LIB  and  for  medium  and  large  it is
  CWINL.LIB.  The last three  libraries,  CWINx.LIB,  MATHx.LIB and
  Cx.LIB, must always be in this exact order.

  NOTE:  The  libraries  EMU.LIB and FP87.LIB will  NEVER  be  used
  in a Windows program.  BC++ will take care of  the floating-point
  math automatically.

  You  will  then  have  to  run  the  Resource Compiler  to  fully
  create a Windows EXE.

  on linking for Windows.
