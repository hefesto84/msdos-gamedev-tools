    TITLE  :  ERRORS:  "Undefined symbol _WSPRINTF in module..."






  "Undefined symbol _WSPRINTF in module..." errors can often be
  eliminated by turning off the "Case-sensitive exports" and
  "Case-sensitive link" options.

  If you are using the command linker TLINKx, don't use the /c
  switch.

  If you are invoking the linker from the command line compiler
  BCCx, use the -lc- switch.

  If you are using the IDE, go to the linker options dialog box and
  turn off case sensitive link (O|L|C) and case sensitive exports
  (O|L|e).
