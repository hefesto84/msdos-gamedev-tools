    TITLE  :  Dealing with Stack Overflow Problems




  Symptoms of stack overflow are numerous.  They include program
  crashing, returning to wrong address, local/global variables
  getting corrupted, and so on.  The default size for the stack is
  4096 bytes, or 4K.  To increase the size of the stack, the
  _stklen variable is used.

  Here's how to make the assignment:

      extern unsigned _stklen = xxxxx;

  where xxxx is a number between 256 - 65535 bytes.

  The variable must be declared in the global memory location in
  the program, and you must include dos.h.  You will get a
  duplicate symbol declaration warning from the linker, which you
  may ignore.

  Note:  The linker map will still report the stack as being 4K,
         even though you changed it's size.  The helpme!.doc also
         describes how to increase the stack length.
