    TITLE  :  Fix for BCWDEMO Line Drawing Example




  BCWDEMO does not draw lines  appropriately  if  drawn  from lower
  right  to  upper  left.  The  replacement  code  below fixes  the
  problem.

  Basically,  the  code   ordering   must  be  changed  and  a  new
  conditional statement  substituted  for  the  old.  Below  code--
  replacement function--fixes the line drawing problem.

  /****************************************************************
   * function DoLButtonUp
   *    When the left mouse button is released, this routine
   *    allows other windows to receive mouse messages and saves
   *    the position of the mouse as the other corner of a bounding
   *    rectangle for the shape.
   ***************************************************************/

  void DoLButtonUp(HWND hWnd, LONG lParam)
  {
      ReleaseCapture();

      /*
       * If the origin of the line has changed, it should be drawn
       * from upper right to lower left and therefore has negative
       * slope.  Otherwise it will have positive slope.
       */

      if (CurrentShape == LINE)
        thisShape[CurrentPoint].Slope =
        (thisShape[CurrentPoint].Points.left < LOWORD(lParam) &&
         thisShape[CurrentPoint].Points.top < HIWORD(lParam)) ||
        (thisShape[CurrentPoint].Points.left > LOWORD(lParam) &&
         thisShape[CurrentPoint].Points.top > HIWORD(lParam))
         ? 1 : -1;

      /*
       * For rectangles to work with the IntersectRect function,
       * they must be stored as left, top, right, bottom.
