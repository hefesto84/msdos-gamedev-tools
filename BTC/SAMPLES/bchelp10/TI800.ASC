    TITLE  :  Don't Overlook argv[0]!




  The declaration

          int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {

  is a familiar sight.  What you may not know is that argv[0] is a
  small treasure.  It is the name of the program that is running.
  It also contains the path of the program.  For instance, if it is
  necessary to know the path from which an exceuting program was
  invoked, use the fnsplit() function to extract the path from
  argv[0].  You can also find out if the program has been renamed
  after it was compiled.
