    TITLE  :  "Unrecoverable Application Error" (UAE)




  "Unrecoverable  Application  Error"  messages    from  a  Windows
  application  are  commonly  caused  by supplying incorrect export
  information to the linker for an application's functions.

  To check that you are supplying appropriate options to the linker
  for your application or  DLL,  review the section in Chapter 3 of
  the  User's Guide that deals with exports.  This  section  has  a
  table with 8 columns  describing  the  possible  combinations you
  might have used  to  build  your  program.   If the setup of your
  program corresponds to one of the last three columns, chances are
  that your program was  not  built correctly (or, at least, as you
  intended).  Column 5 corresponds  to  the  'classical'  method of
  building windows programs  (that  is, all exports are declared in
  the module definition file ( the .def file )).

  The columns that use -WE or -WDE will build 'better' code  in the
  sense that  the compiler will not make 'exportable' any functions
  that it does not actually export.  However, it is here  that many
  people  will  run  into problems.   If  you  have  any  functions
  declared as exports in  the  .def file but the module is compiled
  with -WE or  -WDE,  then  you  probably  have  built  the program
  incorrectly (the function will be exported only if it is preceded
  by _export in the source code).

  If  the  offending  code is NOT a DLL, it is  often  possible  to
  overcome  the  UAE  through  the  use  of  "Smart Callbacks" (-WS
  option).  See   pages  112-113  in  the  User's  Guide  for  more
  information on Smart Callbacks.
