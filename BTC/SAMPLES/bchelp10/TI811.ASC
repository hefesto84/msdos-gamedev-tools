    TITLE  :  Stopping the IDE from Loading the "Default Project"




  The Integrated Development Environment or IDE for Turbo C++ will
  automatically load any .PRJ file in the directory in which TC.EXE
  is run from provided that there is only one .PRJ file in that
  directory.  The IDE is designed to provide a desktop that is
  consistant from one session to another.  However, sometimes you
  may not want the only .PRJ file in a directory to be loaded.  To
  stop Turbo C++'s IDE from loading the .PRJ file you simply need
  to create another .PRJ file in that directory.  This can be done
  in one of several way.  First, you can use COPY CON FOO.PRJ at
  the DOS prompt and press F6.  Second, you can start Turbo C++ and
  choose PROJECT then OPEN PROJECT from the menu and create an
  empty project that is saved.  Lastly, you may use any editor to
  create a file ending in the extension PRJ.  The file that is
  created doesn't have to be in any particular format nor does it
  have to contain data.  If you create a file outside of the IDE,
  DO NOT attempt to open it during any Turbo C++ session.
