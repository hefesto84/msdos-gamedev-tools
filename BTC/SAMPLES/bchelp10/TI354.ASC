  TITLE : FLOATING POINT EVALUATION - PATCTH




  The  following  patch  solves  a  problem  with   floating  point
  evaluation.

  To  apply  this  patch,  you  will  need  to  use the DOS utility
  DEBUG.COM. You may obtain a copy of DEBUG.COM from  one  of  your
  original PC-DOS or MS-DOS diskettes.

  NOTE:
  1.   Do not patch your original Turbo C disk, use  a  working  or
       backup copy of TCC.EXE and TC.EXE for this patch.

  2.   DEBUG is not  sensitive  to  upper  and lower case.  All ad-
       dresses are listed in upper case for ease of readibility.

  3.   XXXX,YYYY,ZZZZ are hexidecimal digits returned by DEBUG. You
       must replace these  digits  accordingly when  typing in your
       commands.

  4.   While in DEBUG, the prompt will appear as a dash (-).

  5.   If you do not  receive  the  appropriate  response,press "q"
       followed by <Enter>, to exit from DEBUG.  Check your version
       number and, if correct, try again.

  6.   TCC.EXE and TC.EXE will not fit together onto  a  360K disk.
       To patch both  programs  on  a  floppy disk, you may need to
       copy TCC.EXE and DEBUG.COM onto  one  disk  and  perform the
       patch. Save  the patched version of TCC.EXE to another disk.
       Repeat the same steps using TC.EXE.

   At the DOS prompt, type  the following information exactly as it
  appears (Conclude each line by pressing <Enter>).


                          Patch for TCC.EXE

       Type the following:                      You will see:
