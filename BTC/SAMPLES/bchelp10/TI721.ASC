    TITLE  :  Biggest Source File that BC++ Can Compile?







  There's no easy measure of the size of a file that can be
  compiled by BC++; it's more a function of complexity: large
  switch statements, deeply nested ors, ifs, whiles, etc. take
  up more memory.

  So if you're running out of memory in a compile, simplify.  And
  compilation is basically done function by function, so shorter
  files won't help much.  It's the complexity within a function
  that will make the compiler hit its limits.

  If you are developing Windows applications, there are lots of
  ways to make your 'winproc' smaller.  One of the best is to
  ignore the usual programming conventions that have grown up
  around windows and do it right.  For a small example of that
  sort of thing, take a look at the TODO demo that comes with BC.
  There are no deeply nested switch statements; not only does
  this effectively solve the problem but it has the added effect
  of making code readable.
