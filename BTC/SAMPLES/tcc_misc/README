TURBO C DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS

These programs were written to demonstrate the usability of the new
Turbo C compiler from Borland International.  A third program allows
source code to be mixed in a listing with the assembly code it creates.

CAVEAT EMPTOR

These programs are marginally useful, and may (probably) have bugs.
They were written mainly for education/demo purposes, and are 
here so you can see how easy it is using Turbo C.  The programs are
commented, which is the extent of the documentation.
